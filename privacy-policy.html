  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>GSC URL Insights</strong> (“the extension”)
    handles user information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    GSC URL Insights does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally
    identifiable information to external servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extension accesses Google Search Console data only after the user explicitly
    signs in with their Google account and grants permission.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Google APIs</h2>
  <p>
    GSC URL Insights uses the Google Search Console API to retrieve search performance
    metrics (such as clicks and impressions) for the currently opened webpage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Access to Google data is read-only and strictly limited to what is necessary for
    displaying page-level insights.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is processed locally within the user’s browser.</li>
    <li>No Google Search Console data is stored permanently.</li>
    <li>No data is shared with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension may use Chrome’s local storage to temporarily store authentication
    status in order to improve user experience and avoid repeated sign-in prompts.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not include analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
  </p>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>
    Users can revoke the extension’s access to their Google account at any time
    through their Google Account permissions.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
    in the latest version of the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the
    extension developer through the Chrome Web Store listing.
